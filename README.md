# Weather-Dashboard-App

## Description

This challenge entailed the creation of a polished weather dashboard that allows users to search by city and get the current and five-day weather forecast for that city. Ajax API calls were used to grab the relevant data, and the values of built-in HTML elements were updated dynamically using jQuery methods. Local storage was used to save user searches and display them in dynamically created buttons; similarly, a "clear search history" button was used to clear local storage and remove all dynamically created search buttons storing previous searches.
